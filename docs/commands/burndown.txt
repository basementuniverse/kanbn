{b}kanbn burndown{b}
{b}kanbn bd{b}

Show a burndown chart between a date range, or for a particular sprint.
If no dates or sprint identifiers are specified, show data for the current sprint.
If no sprints are defined, show data from the earliest created date to the current date.

Options:
  {b}kanbn burndown --json{b}
  {b}kanbn burndown -j{b}
    Output raw data instead of rendering a chart. The data will be returned in JSON format.

  {b}kanbn burndown --sprint N|"name"{b}
  {b}kanbn burndown -p N|"name"{b}
    Show burndown data for the specified sprint. This option can be repeated to show burndown data for multiple sprints.

  {b}kanbn burndown --date "date"{b}
  {b}kanbn burndown -d "date"{b}
    Show burndown data for the specified dates.
    If only one date is provided, show burndown data from this date up to the present date.
    If more than 2 dates are provided, show burndown data from the earliest to latest date.
    This option will be ignored if a valid sprint number or name is specified.

  {b}kanbn burndown --column "column"{b}
  {b}kanbn burndown -c "column"{b}
    Filter for tasks in a particular column. This option can be repeated to include multiple columns.

  {b}kanbn burndown -a "user"{b}
    Filter for tasks that are assigned to a particular user.

  {b}kanbn burndown --normalise "days"|"hours"|"minutes"|"seconds"{b}
  {b}kanbn burndown --n "days"|"hours"|"minutes"|"seconds"{b}
    Normalise dates. Task created, started and completed times will be rounded down to the nearest day, hour, minute or second. This may cause task events to be grouped together.
    If this option is set to a blank or unsupported value, the normalisation mode will be automatically selected based on the date range.
